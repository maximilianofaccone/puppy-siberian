Cherries
by londonali1010

This .conkyrc draws the following:
-- Writes date, battery, CPU bar
-- Writes time
-- Writes CPU & memory process info
-- Displays conkyForecast

This file was written for a desktop of resolution 1024x600. If you want it to run effectively on a monitor with a different resolution, you may need to alter the positioning of the Conky elements.  Please see http://conky.linux-hardcore.com/?page_id=144 for more info on ${goto}, ${offset} and ${voffset}.

In order to use this Conky, you will need to replace XXXXXX in the call for conkyForecast with your location code, as per the instructions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=869328

Requires:
-- Background wallpaper, cherries.jpg (included)
-- font: saxMono, from dafont.com (included)

I do not personally take credit for any of the artwork in this package; the only part of this package that I generated is .conkyrc and the conkyForecast.template.
